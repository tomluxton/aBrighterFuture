# aBrighterFuture
//This exhibition is called "A Brighter Future", wherein people
//passing by would notice the image moving and discover that 
//they can interact with it visa light. When there is a lot of light
//coming from somewhere the image will be perminently revealed. 
//This will prompt users to use a tourch or flashlight to reveal
//the rest of the photo. The first image is always a picture of 
//athletes in the passed, and the photo that is revealed is always a 
//picture of athletes in the present day - this shows that the 
//future/present is always brighter. Thus the name "A Brighter
//Future".
